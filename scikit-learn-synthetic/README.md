# Scikit-learn Synthetic Classification

This is a **beginner-friendly machine learning project** using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.  
The project demonstrates how to generate synthetic data, train a machine learning model, and visualize the results.

## üîπ Project Overview
- We generate a **synthetic 2D dataset** with two classes using `make_classification` from scikit-learn.  
- A **Logistic Regression** model is trained to classify the data points.  
- The project includes **visualization of decision boundaries** and class separation using Matplotlib.  

This is a great starting point for learning the **workflow of a machine learning project**:
1. Data generation / preprocessing  
2. Model training and evaluation  
3. Visualization of results
